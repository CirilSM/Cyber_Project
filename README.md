The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a particular text can be classed as hostile by utilizing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, try to pinpoint the precise kind of objectionable contentâ€”for example, content that offends based on someone's age, gender, religion, or race. By combining cutting-edge NLP and ML approaches, the method analyzes text data and extracts relevant patterns.
